AnalyticsDemo
=============

A iOS demonstration of analytics reporting using Adobe Site Catalyst and Google Analytics

This demo sends page tags and event tags. Search for the ```//TODO:``` comments in the code base to customize for your server's setup.

For Site Catalyst, SSL is set to ```NO``` for testing with Adobe Bloodhound. Turn SSL on to send tags to the server.
